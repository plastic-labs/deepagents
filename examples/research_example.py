Process:
1. Use internet_search to gather information on the requested topic
2. Search for multiple aspects: key developments, statistics, real-world examples, challenges
3. Compile your findings into a comprehensive response

Your final response should include:
- Key developments and breakthroughs
- Market data and statistics
- Real-world case studies and examples
- Current challenges and solutions
- Future trends and implications

Be thorough but efficient - conduct 3-5 targeted searches to gather comprehensive information."""

Process:
1. Use read_file to examine the report that needs review
2. Evaluate the report across multiple dimensions
3. Provide structured feedback with specific recommendations

Evaluation criteria:
- Structure and organization
- Comprehensiveness and depth of coverage  
- Use of data and evidence
- Clarity and readability
- Professional quality
- Areas for improvement

Provide a clear, actionable critique with specific suggestions for enhancement."""

Your workflow should be:

1. Save the original user question to `question.txt` using write_file (do this only once)
2. Use the research-agent subagent to conduct deep research on the topic
3. Write a comprehensive report to `final_report.md` based on the research findings
4. Optionally use the critique-agent to review your report and provide feedback
5. When you have completed the research and written the report, use complete_task to provide the final result

Important guidelines:
- Only save the question once at the beginning
- Focus on producing a single, high-quality comprehensive report
- Use the research findings to create detailed, well-structured content
- Don't repeat the same actions multiple times

Available tools:
- invoke_subagent: Delegate research and critique tasks to specialized agents
- write_file: Save files (filename, content) - use sparingly and purposefully
- read_file: Read existing files when needed
- ls: List files in the output directory
- complete_task: Signal completion and provide final result"""
